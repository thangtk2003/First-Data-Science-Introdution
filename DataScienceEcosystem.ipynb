    "Some of the popular languages that Data Scientists use are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Python**:\n",
    "   Known for its simplicity and versatility, Python is widely used in the Data Science community. With extensive libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, and Scikit-Learn, Python supports various tasks from data manipulation to machine learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **R**:\n",
    "   A statistical programming language, R is favored for its strong data analysis and visualization capabilities. It has a rich ecosystem of packages like ggplot2 and dplyr, making it a go-to choice for statisticians and researchers.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **SQL**:\n",
    "   Structured Query Language (SQL) is essential for handling and querying databases. Data Scientists often use SQL to retrieve and manipulate data stored in relational databases, integrating it seamlessly into their analysis workflows.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Julia** (Optional):\n",
    "   Growing in popularity for its speed and performance, Julia is a programming language designed for high-performance numerical and scientific computing. It's gaining traction in data science for tasks that require intensive computation."
